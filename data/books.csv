Save Your Work
After adding your folder and data files in VS Code, use git to add / commit / and push your content to GitHub. 

Schema Matters! 
The exact column types are important. If you use GUIDs in your sample data, when creating your SQLite table, you'll want to use a text field to hold that column.

Did you have any challenges creating your data folder or planning your data sources: One problem I had was that originally I made data as a file. But then I couldn't add authors or books as subfiles. I had to change data to a folder and then I could add files below it. Also, I was a little confused on the instructions because I wasn't sure if I was supposed to do a whole bunch of editing as per above or if it was enough to just have the files made. I decided it was enough to have the files made and am seeking to understand if we'll be doing editing with removing or adding books or authors in the next assignment.

3 . Challenges and How I Solved Them

Challenge 1: FileNotFoundError when loading CSVs.

This happened because my data/ folder was in the wrong directory.

Solution: I moved data/ into my project root (C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\datafun-05-sql).

Challenge 2: Empty query results

At first, books.db was created without data.

Solution: I deleted the database, fixed load_data.py, and re-ran to ensure CSV rows inserted correctly.

Challenge 3: Adding new column (is_favorite)

SQLite doesnâ€™t allow editing table definitions directly.

Solution: I added the column when creating the books table (is_favorite BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0).

Now my project runs correctly and outputs books + authors + favorite flag.

Did you have any challenges creating your data folder or planning your data sources: No.  Originally I was going to grab data for airlines and crashes from github but then decided to keep it smaller and only pulled part of the data.  Made it more inline with the example author and books.

Did you have any challenges creating your data folder or planning your data sources: Yes, I did run into some challenges while creating my data folder and planning the data sources. At first, I accidentally put my CSV files in the root project folder instead of a dedicated data/ folder, so I had to learn how to move them and update Git.
